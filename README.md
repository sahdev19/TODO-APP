# TODO-APP
📝 Todo List Web Application  
Developed a full-stack Todo List web application using Node.js and Express.js for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through a RESTful API, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete tasks efficiently. Todo data is stored on the server in a JSON file, ensuring persistence even after page refresh. The frontend communicates with the backend using the Fetch API and async/await, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
